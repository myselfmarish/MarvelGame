# Virtual Marvel Game - Yes Or No 

A virtual “The Yes Or No” game is a quikfire, rapid speaking game which you can play online. The “Yes Or No” game rules are nice and simple. You ask a person a long series of questions that would normally require that they answer “Yes” or “No”,  the person isn’t allowed to say either of these words. Think of one of the Marvel’s characters in the list and answer the question Y or N. At the end computer should give your character.
